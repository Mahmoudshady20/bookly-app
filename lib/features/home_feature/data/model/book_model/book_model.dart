Updated to cover the new features of C# 4.0, including dynamic binding, named and optional parameters, and covariant and contravariant generic types, this release takes the language to the next level by adding the ability to cleanly write programs that don’t rely on static type definitions. This allows dynamic programming languages such as Python, Ruby, and JavaScript to feel native to C#. The C# Programming Language, Fourth Edition, continues to be the authoritative and annotated technical reference for C# 4.0. 7nbsp; Written by Anders Hejlsberg, the language’s architect, and his colleagues, Mads Torgersen, Scott Wiltamuth, and Peter Golde, this volume has been completely updated for C# 4.0. The book provides the complete specification of the language, along with descriptions, reference materials, code samples, and annotations from twelve prominent C# gurus. The many annotations bring a depth and breadth of understanding rarely found in any programming book. As the main text of the book introduces the concepts of the C# language, cogent annotations explain why they are important, how they are used, how they relate to other languages, and even how they evolved. This book is the definitive, must-have reference for any developer who wants to understand C#. With annotations from: Brad Abrams, Joseph Albahari, Krzysztof Cwalina, Jesse Liberty, Eric Lippert, Christian Nagel, Vladimir Reshetnikov, Marek Safar, Chris Sells, Peter Sestoft, Jon Skeet, and Bill Wagner.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780132481724"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0132481723"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":1072,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Computers"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.10.8.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=s-IH_x6ytuQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=s-IH_x6ytuQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com.eg/books?id=s-IH_x6ytuQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=programming&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=s-IH_x6ytuQC&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=s-IH_x6ytuQC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"EG","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":688.51,"currencyCode":"EGP"},"retailPrice":{"amount":688.51,"currencyCode":"EGP"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=s-IH_x6ytuQC&rdid=book-s-IH_x6ytuQC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":688510000,"currencyCode":"EGP"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":688510000,"currencyCode":"EGP"}}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"EG","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=s-IH_x6ytuQC&hl=&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"This book is the definitive, must-have reference for any developer who wants to understand C#.

What You Will Learn Get to know the difference between imperative and functional approaches See the use of first-class functions and pure functions in a functional style Discover various techniques to apply immutable state to avoid side effects Design a recursive algorithm effectively Create faster programs using lazy evaluation Structure code using design patterns to make the design process easier Use concurrency techniques to develop responsive software Learn how to use the C++ Standard Template Library and metaprogramming in a functional way to improve code optimization In Detail Functional programming allows developers to divide programs into smaller, reusable components that ease the creation, testing, and maintenance of software as a whole. Combined with the power of C++, you can develop robust and scalable applications that fulfill modern day software requirements. This book will help you discover all the C++ 17 features that can be applied to build software in a functional way. The book is divided into three modules—the first introduces the fundamentals of functional programming and how it is supported by modern C++. The second module explains how to efficiently implement C++ features such as pure functions and immutable states to build robust applications. The last module describes how to achieve concurrency and apply design patterns to enhance your application's performance. Here, you will also learn to optimize code using metaprogramming in a functional way. By the end of the book, you will be familiar with the functional approach of programming and will be able to use these techniques on a daily basis. Style and approach This book uses a module-based approach, where each module will cover important aspects of functional programming in C++ and will help you develop efficient and robust applications through gaining a practical understanding.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781787280588"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1787280586"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":298,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Computers"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"2.2.3.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MJZGDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MJZGDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com.eg/books?id=MJZGDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=programming&hl=&cd=6&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MJZGDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MJZGDwAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"EG","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":1549.47,"currencyCode":"EGP"},"retailPrice":{"amount":1549.47,"currencyCode":"EGP"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MJZGDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-MJZGDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":1549470000,"currencyCode":"EGP"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":1549470000,"currencyCode":"EGP"}}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"EG","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=MJZGDwAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Apply Functional Programming techniques to C++ to build highly modular, testable, and reusable code About This Book Modularize your applications and make them highly reusable and testable Get familiar with complex concepts such as ..."}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"wXEZAQAAIAAJ","etag":"iV19ehc07NY","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/wXEZAQAAIAAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"Programming Language Concepts","authors":["Carlo Ghezzi","Mehdi Jazayeri"],"publisher":"John Wiley & Sons","publishedDate":"1998","description":"This book explains and illustrates key concepts of programming by taking a breadth approach to programming languages.

Ltd.","description":"The book, now in its Second Edition, follows the structure of the first edition. It introduces computer programming to a beginner using the programming language C. The version of C used is the one standardised by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI C). C has rapidly gained users due to its efficiency, availability of rich data structures, a large variety of operators, and its affinity to the UNIX operating system. C is a difficult language to learn if it is not methodically approached. The attempt has been to introduce the basic aspects of C to enable the student to quickly start writing C programs and postpone more difficult features of C to later chapters. After reading the first eleven chapters, a beginner can start writing complete programs to solve useful problems. Difficult concepts such as the use of pointers and recursion are explained lucidly with many examples. The book is eminently suitable for undergraduate and postgraduate students of computer science/engineering students as per the prescribed syllabus of several universities.
